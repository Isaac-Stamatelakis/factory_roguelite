# CaveTech
CaveTech is a 2D factory game currently being developed in Unity. CaveTech is a fusion of Terraria and Modded Minecraft that is heavily inspired by the minecraft modpack GregTech New Horizons with aspects of GregTech, EnderIO, AE2, BetterQuesting, LootGames, and more. All coding, art, etc are custom built for this project. This is mostly a hobby project although I do have ambitions of delivering an experience similar to GregTech New Horizons but with changes that will make it more accessible to a larger audience.

## Outline
The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves, with the goal of eventually upgrading the teleporter enough to teleport out of the cave and return to civilization.

## Features in CaveTech:
* Cave generation system with a wide variety of generation types, ore veins, decorations, and random structures.
* Tile system with 4 different tile types: block, background, object and conduit all of which include many subtypes.
* Item system featuring many item types including crafting, tiles, conduits, and many more. Includes a special transmutable item type for items with many different states.
* Tile entity system to add behavior to tiles placed in the world including storage, light sources, machines, puzzles, signs, doors, ladders, teleporters,  and many more.
* Recipe system featuring five recipe types: item, generator, passive, burner, and transmutation.
* Conduit system featuring 5 different types of conduits. Energy, item and fluid move resources between tile entities. Signal can be interacted with by tile entities and interact with other tile entities. Matrix connects tile entities to a large item system.
* Entity system supporting item entities, and (In-Progress) various creatures.
* Item Catalogue for searching up items, viewing recipes for items and item usages in recipes, and item information.
* Compact machines which "shrink space" allowing players to build inside of them and transfer materials in and out. They support a recursive depth of up to 7.
* Questbook that guides players through the game and rewards them for completing quests such as item retrieval, visiting a cave, and more.
* (In-Progress) Matrix item system supporting a massive centralized item storage, item IO and auto crafting. 
* Many Unity editor tools for generating assets as well as in game developer tools for editing questbooks, and building structures.
