This is a game I have been working on for about a year with a friend in animation. It's my passion project as its a mixture of two of my all time favourite games Terraria and Modded Minecraft. 

The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves, with the goal of eventually upgrading the teleporter enough to teleport out of the cave and return to civilization.

The game is developed in Unity and includes many features:
* Item system with many item types including: crafting, tile, transmutable, conduit and more.
* Recipe system with recipe types including: item, energy, and transmutation.
* Tile system with 4 different tile types: base, background, object and platform.
* Tile entity system to add behavior to tiles placed in the world such as chests, torches, and many more.
* Conduit system with 5 different types of conduits for moving resources: Energy, item, fluid, signal and matrix.
* Cave generation system with a wide variety of generation types and decoration options
* Recursive compact machines which "shrink space" allowing players to build inside of them, and transfer materials.
* Questbook with in game editing that guides players through the game. Three different quests types: item retreiveal, cave dimension and checkbox with rewards for completion.
